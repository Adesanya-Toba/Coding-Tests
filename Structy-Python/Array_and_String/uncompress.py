Write a function, uncompress, that takes in a string as an argument.
The input string will be formatted into multiple groups according
to the following pattern:

<number><char>

for example, '2c' or '3a'.
The function should return an uncompressed version of the string
where each 'char' of a group is repeated 'number' times consecutively.
